#### Binary to Decimal converter

Idea from [here](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Bin2Dec-App.md)

Binary is the number system all digital computers are based on. Therefore it's important for developers to understand binary, or base 2, mathematics. The purpose of Bin2Dec is to provide practice and understanding of how binary calculations.

Bin2Dec allows the user to enter strings of up to 8 binary digits, 0's and 1's, in any sequence and then displays its decimal equivalent.

### User Tools

* [x] ~User can enter up to 8 binary digits in one input field~
* [x] ~User must be notified if anything other than a 0 or 1 was entered~
* [x] ~User views the results in a single output field containing the decimal (base 10) equivalent of the binary number that was entered~
